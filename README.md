# PCA Example Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** using the Iris dataset. PCA is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction, often used in machine learning and data visualization tasks.

## How to Use This Notebook

You can interact with this notebook directly in your browser without installing anything! Simply click the Binder badge below, and it will launch the notebook in a live, interactive environment.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yourusername/PCA_Example/main?filepath=PCA_example.ipynb)

Once you launch the notebook:
1. You will be able to run the code cells by pressing **Shift + Enter**.
2. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different parameters, and see the effect on the PCA results.
3. Your changes will not affect the original notebook or the work of other students.

## What is PCA?

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much information (variance) as possible. It is often used in the fields of machine learning and data analysis to simplify models, reduce noise, and visualize high-dimensional data.

### Contents of the Notebook
- **Loading the Iris dataset**: A popular dataset consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features.
- **Standardizing the data**: Preprocessing step to ensure all features have the same scale.
- **Applying PCA**: Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset from 4 dimensions to 2 dimensions.
- **Visualizing PCA**: Using scatter plots to visualize how PCA transforms the data.
