# Introductory Lecture on PCA 

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** using the 'Admission Officer' example we discussed in class. You will also see the lecture notes in this repository. 

PCA is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction, often used in machine learning and data visualization tasks.

## How to Use This Notebook
You can download the code and work with this code on a jupyter notebook from your browser or from any platform you can use Python. 
Or you can interact with this notebook directly in your browser without installing anything! Simply click the Binder badge below, and it will launch the notebook in a live, interactive environment. This can take some time to open it.

Once you launch the notebook:
1. You will be able to run the code cells by pressing **Shift + Enter**.
2. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different parameters, and see the effect on the PCA results.
3. Your changes will not affect the original notebook or the work of other students.

## What is PCA?

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much information (variance) as possible. It is often used in the fields of machine learning and data analysis to simplify models, reduce noise, and visualize high-dimensional data.

### Contents of the Notebook
- **Creating the dataset**: Consisting of 3 stduents with 5 features.
- **Standardizing the data**: Preprocessing step to ensure all features have the same scale.
- **Applying PCA**: Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset from 5 dimensions to 2 dimensions.

## How to Save Your Work

If you want to save your changes, follow these steps:
1. Go to **File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)** to download your modified notebook.
2. You can then upload the notebook to your own Jupyter environment or share it with others.
